# Semantic-Information-Retrieval-System
A semantic information retrieval system which checks the context of the user query and return results accordingly

Due to the increasing number of repositories consisting of digital information, there has been a heavy demand for information retrieval systems. 
Information Retrieval is the process of obtaining a set of documents, from a document repository, that is most relevant to the user’s query which is written in a natural language. 
However, the traditional mechanism for retrieval of information makes the search inefficient.
It is because such systems use keywordbased matching techniques without incorporating the overall meaning of the query.
Most of the conventional search engines do not include some of the most essential contents relevant to the user's search query.
It has been seen in most of the retrieval systems that the context and semantics of the request made by the user are not analyzed to its full extent.
Hence, it is not able to provide accurate results and this leads to the user reforming the query repeatedly till more relevant documents are fetched. 
Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the intent of the user as well as the contextual meaning of the query. 
The addition of semantic knowledge to the user queries, in turn, enhances the search performance. 

This project aims to develop a Semantic Information Retrieval model to perform an efficient search on a collection of documents and rank them based on their
relevance to the user’s query
